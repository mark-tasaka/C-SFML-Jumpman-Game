# C-SFML-Jumpman-Game
Written in C++ and utilizing the SFML library, Jumpman is a scratch build game inspired by the original 1983 Mario Brothers.  The purpose of creating Jumpman is a way to develop my C++ and game development skills.   Jumpman uses object-oriented program and incorporates inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in the program structure.

-------------

Background:

Something strange is happening with the City sewers.  Mutant turtles are emerging from people’s toilets and slime is flowing out of the taps.  Sanitation Workers were dispatched to investigate this issue; none have returned from the sewers.  Now, it is up to Jumpman, the hero who captured the Disgruntled Gorilla, to save the City.

------------

How to Play:


Move Right: Right Arrow Key

Move Left: Left Arrow Key

Jump: Spacebar

Pause Game: Enter Key

Exit Game: Escape Key


--------------

Objective:

The objective of Jumpman is to clear each stage.  Creatures will emerge from the top sewer pipes and travel downwards to exit from the bottom sewer pipes.  Every stage a set number of creatures will emerge from the sewer pipes.  When the last of the creatures exits from the bottom sewer pipes, the stage is cleared.  Jumpman has two ways of dealing with the creatures; he could either avoid the creatures or he could knock the creatures unconscious by ‘jumping’ on the walkway below the creatures.

As the stages progress, the creatures become more numerous and their speed increases.  As well, newer, more powerful types of creatures are introduced at higher stages.  Points are awarded for each creature ‘knocked out’.  For every 500 points, Jumpman received an extra life!

Added more functionally to the code.


Update 1.01: 2021-02-20

New graphics have been added to mark the transition between the stages/modes (i.e. pause, game over).  New classes have been created shaping the file structure/skeleton of the game (i.e. parent->child classes).
